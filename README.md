# Python_EDA_Sales_Analysis

Here is the data for Diwali sale and the vendor wants insights on the basis of the data. I've utilized Python to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), delving into the dataset to uncover valuable insights and patterns. 
Through this process, I've sifted through the data, examined various measures, visualized comparisons, and probed relationships among different variables. 
This comprehensive exploration has allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset's characteristics and extract meaningful conclusions to inform decision-making processes.
The Key learnings from the EDA:
 - improved customer experience by identifying potencial customers across different states, occupation, gender and age groups.
 - improved sales by identifying most selling product categories and products, which can help inventory and hence meet the demands.
